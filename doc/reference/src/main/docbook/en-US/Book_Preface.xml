   <para>
      This guide describes how to download, install, configure, and run the
      Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) used to verify the compatibility of an
      implementation of the JSR 346: Context and Dependency Injection for Java
      EE (CDI) 1.1 specification.
   </para>
   <para>
      The CDI TCK is built atop TestNG framework and Arquillian platform. The CDI TCK uses 
      the Arquillian version <emphasis>1.1.2.Final</emphasis> to execute the test suite.

      <para>
         This guide is for implementors of the Context and Dependency
         Injection
         for Java EE 1.1 technology to assist in running the test
         suite
         that verifies the compatibility of their implementation.

      <title>Before You Read This Book</title>

      <para>
         Before reading this guide, you should familiarize yourself with the
         Java EE programming model, specifically the Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB)
         3.1 and the Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE 1.1
         specifications. A good resource for the Java EE programming model is
         the
         <ulink url="http://jcp.org">JCP</ulink>
         web site.
      </para>
      <para>
         The CDI TCK is based on the Context and Dependency Injection for Java
         EE 1.1 technology specification (JSR 346). Information about the
         specification, including links to the specification documents, can be
         found on the
         <ulink url="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=346">JSR 346 JCP page</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>
         Before running the tests in the CDI TCK, read and become
         familiar with the Arquillian testing platform. A good starting point could be 
         a series of <ulink url="http://arquillian.org/guides/">Arquillian Guides</ulink>.

      <para>
         If you are running the CDI TCK for the first time, read
         <xref linkend="introduction" />
         completely for the necessary background information about the TCK. 
         Once you have reviewed that
         material, perform the steps outlined in the remaining chapters.

               gives an overview of the principles that apply generally to all
               Technology Compatibility Kits (TCKs), outlines the appeals
               process and describes the CDI TCK architecture and components. It
               also includes a broad overview of how the TCK is executed and
               lists the platforms on which the TCK has been tested and
               verified.
