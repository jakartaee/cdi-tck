   <title>Introduction (CDI TCK)</title>

   <para>
      This chapter explains the purpose of a TCK and identifies the
      foundation elements of the CDI TCK.
   </para>
   <section>
      <title>TCK Primer</title>
      <para>
         A TCK, or Technology Compatibility Kit, is one of the three required
         pieces for any JSR (the other two being the specification document and
         the reference implementation). The TCK is a set of tools and tests to
         verify that an implementation of the technology conforms to the
         specification. The tests are the primary component, but the tools serve
         an equally critical role of providing a framework and/or set of SPIs
         for executing the tests.
      </para>
      <para>
         The tests in the TCK are derived from assertions in the written
         specification document. The assertions are itemized in an XML
         document, where they each get assigned a unique identifier, and
         materialize as a suite of automated tests that collectively validate
         whether an implementation complies with the aforementioned assertions,
         and in turn the specification. For a particular implementation to be
         certified, all of the required tests must pass (i.e., the provided
         test suite must be run unmodified).
      </para>
      <para>
         A TCK is entirely implementation agnostic. Ideally, it should validate
         assertions by consulting the specification's public API.  However, when
         the information returned by the public API is not low-level enough to
         validate the assertion, the implementation must be consulted directly.
         In this case, the TCK provides an independent API as part of a porting
         package that enables this transparency. The porting package must be
         implemented for each CDI implementation. <xref linkend="tck-components" /> introduces the
         porting package and <xref linkend="porting-package" /> covers the requirements for
         implementing it.
      </para>
      <note>
         <para>
            Oracle Corporation will implement the porting package for the
            CDI RI and test the CDI RI on the Java EE Reference Implementation.
         </para>

   <section>
      <title>Compatibility Testing</title>

      <para>
         The goal of any specification is to eliminate portability problems
         so long as the program which uses the implementation also conforms to
         the rules laid out in the specification.
      </para>
      <para>
         Executing the TCK is a form of compatibility testing. It's important
         to understand that compatibility testing is distinctly different from
         product testing. The TCK is not concerned with robustness, performance
         or ease of use, and therefore cannot vouch for how well an
         implementation meets these criteria. What a TCK can do is to ensure the
         exactness of an implementation as it relates to the specification.
      </para>
      <para>
         Compatibility testing of any feature relies on both a complete
         specification and a complete reference implementation. The reference
         implementation demonstrates how each test can be passed and provides
         additional context to the implementor during development for the
         corresponding assertion.
      </para>

         <title>Why Compatibility Is Important</title>
         <para>
            Java platform compatibility is important to different groups
            involved with Java technologies for different reasons:

            <listitem>
               <para>
                  Compatibility testing is the means by which the JCP ensures
                  that the Java platform does not become fragmented as it's
                  ported to different operating systems and hardware.

                  Compatibility testing benefits developers working in the
                  Java programming language, enabling them to write applications
                  once and deploy them across heterogeneous computing
                  environments without porting.

            The CDI specification goes to great lengths to ensure that
            programs written for Java EE are compatible and the TCK is rigorous
            about enforcing the rules the specification lays down.

      <title>About the CDI TCK</title>

      <para>
         The CDI TCK is designed as a portable, configurable and automated test
         suite for verifying the compatibility of an implementation of the
         JSR 346: Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java EE 1.1 specification.
         The test suite is built atop TestNG framework and Arquillian platform.
      </para>
      <para>
         Each test class in the suite acts as a deployable unit. The
         deployable units, or artifacts, can be either a WAR or an EAR.
      </para>
      <note>
         <para>
           The test archives are built with ShrinkWrap, a Java API for creating archives. ShrinkWrap is a part of the Arqullian platform ecosystem.
