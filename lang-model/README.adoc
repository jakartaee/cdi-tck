= CDI Language Model TCK

The Language Model TCK does not depend on any test framework or test runner.
Assertions are made using Java `assert`.
The tests are executed in an implementation-defined manner.

To run the Language Model TCK, implementations must call the `org.jboss.cdi.lang.model.tck.LangModelVerifier#verify()` static method and pass it a `ClassInfo` object for the `LangModelVerifier` class.
The way how this method is called and how the `ClassInfo` object is obtained are not specified, so that implementations are free to use whatever works best for them.
Two conditions must be satisfied:

- assertions are enabled;
- the language model under test is configured to only return runtime-retained annotations.

If the `verify` method returns successfully, the TCK passed.
If it throws an exception, the TCK failed.

To aid with debugging, the `verify` method prints a message to the JVM standard output in case of a success.

== Recommendation

For CDI implementations, it is easiest to run the Language Model TCK using a build compatible extension.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class LangModelVerifierExtension implements BuildCompatibleExtension {
    @Enhancement(types = LangModelVerifier.class, withAnnotations = Annotation.class)
    public void run(ClassInfo clazz) {
        LangModelVerifier.verify(clazz);
    }
}
----
